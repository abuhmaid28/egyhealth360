# Testing Strategy V1

## Principle
A feature is not done because code compiles or a screen renders. Tests are selected by risk and requirement coverage.

## Core layers
- Unit/domain tests
- Database constraint tests
- Integration tests against PostgreSQL
- API contract/validation tests
- Authorization/IDOR regression tests
- Frontend behavior/accessibility tests
- Playwright golden-journey E2E tests
- Security/regression tests
- Research-integrity/reproducibility tests

## EACCE golden cases
At minimum test deterministic cases for:
- NOT_DUE
- COMPLETED
- SCHEDULED
- TRUE_GAP
- UNCERTAIN
- EXEMPT

Edge cases include irrelevant missing windows, cancelled future appointments, out-of-window completion evidence, duplicate events, conflicting evidence, and deterministic repeatability.

Classification and explanation/reason codes must remain logically consistent.

## Authorization matrix
Automated tests must verify:
- Patient A -> own data allowed
- Patient A -> Patient B denied
- Clinician -> assigned patient allowed
- Clinician -> unassigned patient denied
- Admin -> normal clinical editing denied

Every protected endpoint referencing patient/care-plan/action/assessment IDs requires object-level authorization regression coverage.

## Research-integrity tests
- ground-truth-only fields absent from engine inputs
- Baseline and EACCE receive equivalent observed inputs
- corruption deterministic for fixed seed/config
- corruption does not change preserved ground truth
- silent missingness supplies no hidden hint
- metrics verified against small known confusion matrices
- small experiment reproducible across repeated runs

## Golden E2E journeys
1. Clinician -> TRUE_GAP case -> explanation -> confirm
2. Clinician -> incomplete-coverage case -> UNCERTAIN, not confirmed gap
3. New evidence changes current classification while preserving history
4. Patient -> plan -> BP measurement flow
5. Admin -> Evaluation Lab -> experiment completes -> real metrics displayed

## CI
Typical PR gate:
Lint -> Typecheck -> Unit -> EACCE Golden -> DB/Integration -> Authorization/API -> critical frontend tests -> Build.

Add Playwright golden journeys once the application foundation is stable. Full research matrix is not required on every PR; CI uses a small smoke experiment and full runs are explicit research workflows.

## Demo readiness
A deterministic demo-verification command should verify database health, demo seed, logins, and fixed TRUE_GAP/UNCERTAIN/SCHEDULED/COMPLETED scenarios before the final presentation.

## Bug policy
Every meaningful fixed bug receives a regression test. Final-demo target: zero known P0/P1 defects.
